## Rotten-Tomatoes-Model-Comparison
I have performed an analysis on the Rotten Tomatoes Dataset to predict if a review is rotten or fresh. Each of the words in the review is (one-hot) encoded as a feature. Thus, this problem has about 18k features. Various models are compared: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression with Forward Selection, Logistic Regression with Regularization (Ridge and Lasso), Na√Øve Bayes Classification, Decision Trees, Random Forests and Ada Boost. Each of these models are compared using a custom built accuracy function when cross-validating the data.
